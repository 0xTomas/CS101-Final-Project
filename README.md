# CS101-Final-Project
Here is my final project for Computer Science 101.

What's the project scope?
> Create a basic, two-player version of tic-tac-toe using Python3. 

What does your program do?
> It accepts text input from the user to mark 'X's and 'O's into a 3x3 grid. The player with a line of three 'X's or 'O's is the winner.

How will it work in a terminal?
> The program displays the current gameboard after every move in the form of ASCII art.
